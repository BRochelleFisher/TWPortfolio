    length, and vocabulary. The rules define a subset of the natural language
    as allowed. Specifically in technical writing, many CLs limit the verbs
    you can use. This enforces consistency for all your documentation and
    conforms to or builds an industry standard for your products.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d55e12"></a>CL or Taxonomy?</h3></div></div></div><p>In general terms, a taxonomy is a structured CL, with parents and
      children. For example, in biology the same terms are used for the
      structure: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. In
      Artificial Intelligence (AI), the structure may be AI, Machine Learning,
      Human Crowd-Sourced, Neural Networks, Deep Learning. </p><p>In technical writing, the taxonomy is usually for different
      audiences of a product: system administrator, basic end-user, advanced
      end-user, superuser, C-level decision maker. There will be a default CL,
      with all the rules that apply to all audiences, and a dictionary for
      each personna. For example, a taxonomy for a decision maker will be used
      mainly by Marketing and will allow the word
      <span class="emphasis"><em>leverage</em></span> with the meaning "to use a foundation
      feature to reach the solution for which the product exists". In the
      taxonomy for all other audiences, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>leverage
      </em></span>is not allowed, and its alternative is
      <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span>.</p><p>A Taxonomy Manager for a company that creates a shopping app for
      SmartPhones will be in charge of labeling strategies, to create the best
      possible results for a search string. A Taxonomy Manager for a cyber
      security company will create a CL for different audiences and acquire a
      tool to enforce it. With this ambiguity, we will make our first rule:
      <span class="emphasis"><em>taxonomy</em></span> is not allowed in this documentation, and
      its alternative is <span class="emphasis"><em>CL</em></span>. </p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d55e29"></a>Benefits of a CL</h3></div></div></div><p>Adopting and enforcing a CL is the solution to many technical
      writing issues.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If your organization has a team of writers, the CL enforces
          consistency of the content among the writers. If you have one
          writer, the CL enforces consistency over time among the
          documents.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you translate your content, the reduced vocabulary and
          grammar and the re-use of matching content, makes translation
          significantly cheaper and often of better quality.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have a global market but do not have the budget for
          localization, the CL makes it easier for non-native speakers to read
          and use your documentation correctly. If your documentation is
          online, built-in machine translation (such as Google Translate) will
          give better results.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the technical writers in your organization internalize your
          CL and re-use strategy, their productivity will increase.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use of a CL will cut your content by at least 30% without loss
          of information. Concise documentation makes it easier for users to
          find what is relevant to them at the time, makes it clear to
          reviewers and stake-holders what is not relevant or incorrect, and
          makes the documented steps easier to follow.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d55e43"></a>Scope of Project</h2></div></div></div><p>This is a personal project of Rochelle Fisher, June 2025.
