 <section><title>Work the Next Words</title>
 <para>You will analyze how your dictionary words are used in your aggregated sample. We will begin with the top words. Then we will go through
 the words that are used one time only.</para>
 <procedure>
	<title>To analyze words:</title>
	<step>Open your aggregated document that you used as input for the Python script.</step>
	<step>Search for the word to analyze. We like to use Notepad++, to get all the results in a list, each result with context.</step>
	<step>From the context:
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>See if the word is used in more than one part of speech. If it is, and it is not obvious which is the most common, count the instances of each PoS.</listitem>
			<listitem>See if the word is used with more than one defintion. If it is, note the defitions. Use counts, industry standards, and internet searches to get the best defintion.
			
			</listitem>
		
		
		</itemizedlist>
	</step>
	<step>Enter a draft definition for each usage. </step>
	<step></step>

	<title>Examples of Word Analysis</title>
	<para>Let's start with <wordasword>organizational</wordasword>.</para>
	<procedure>
		<title>To set <wordasword>organizational</wordasword> as a word in our CL:</title>
		<step>Open the file with all your textual content. We named this file <filename>sampleAgg.txt</filename>.</step>
		<step>Search for <wordasword>organizational</wordasword>.
			<para>We found this:*</para>
			<blockquote>Produce intelligence that will be embedded into organizational workflows and would serve decision-makers.</blockquote>
			<para>* This sentence belongs to one of the organizations from whom we used samples.  </para>
		</step>
		<step>Analyzing the use of <wordasword>organizational</wordasword>, we see ambiguity. Does the author mean that the workflows are organized? That they are for the organization? That there are
		different workflows for different groups in the hierarchy?
		<para>If we remove the word, it does not change the meaning, as far as we can see. We decide that this word is not allowed. If we 
		had access to the SME, we would discuss their meaning and find alternatives. 
		</para>
		
		<para>Suggestion: You have access to your SMEs. Set your CL words as best as you can. Then, discuss multiple words with similar issues. Edit your CL for alternative words and other decisions.</para>
		</step>
	</procedure>
	<para>Our next task is to work through the top words that are not obviously allowed or not allowed. Sort the dictionary by <guilabel>Count</guilabel>.
	</para>
	<para>Our first word to work through is <wordasword>event</wordasword>.
	</para>
	<procedure>
		<title>Analyzing <wordasword>event</wordasword>:</title>
		
		<step>In Notepad++, we search for <wordasword>event</wordasword> in the aggregated text. We get 1417 results, for <wordasword>event</wordasword> and <wordasword>events</wordasword>. As we read the results, 
		we make the defintion draft:<para>a security incident detected on the secured network</para></step>
		<step>The fifth result is for a procedure to create an event in the security application. We fix our defintion from more samples to include threat intelligence data and usage:  
		<blockquote>object that contains a cybersecurity incident, report, or finding, with attributes, identifiers, and other data for analysis, prevention, and mitigation</blockquote>
		
		</step>
		<step>We see that <wordasword>event</wordasword> is used with other definitions:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>a system or user action</listitem>
				<listitem>a phrase: "in the event this happens"</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para> 
			</para>
		</step>
		
		
	</procedure>
	<itemizedlist>
		<title>Results:</title>
		<listitem>The first definition fits for almost every security solution with threat analysis and threat hunting features.</listitem>
		<listitem>The second definition is a technical name for a specfic product. For our general cybersecurity dictionary, it does not fit. We can communicate actions in errors and logs with their names, without the use of <wordasword>event</wordasword>.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>The third usage is a verbose phrase to mean <wordasword>if</wordasword>.</listitem>
		<listitem>The word is used in CLI or API commands and in pathnames. Our checker tool must ignore code, filenames, and pathnames.<note>This is an advantage of an XML technical writing tool. We can use 
		elements that set content by type: &lt;code&gt;, &lt;codeblock&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pathname&gt;, and similar. It will be easy to set the tool to ignore text in these elements. 
		We add a rule to our style guide to use these elements.
		</note></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>We sort the dictionary by <guilabel>Word</guilabel>, to configure the plural with the singular. We enter the definition, good example, and bad example. In the bad example, we add a note in parentheses.
	We will be able to sort by these notes to make rules later. We set the <guilabel>PoS</guilabel> to <literal>command</literal> and <guilabel>Allowed</guilabel> to <literal>T</literal> for the words that start
	with <wordasword>event</wordasword> and are obviously commands or pathnames.</para>
