A Controlled Language (CL) is set of rules for grammar, sentence length, and vocabulary. The rules define a subset of the natural language as allowed. Specifically in technical writing, many CLs limit the verbs you can use. This enforces consistency for all your documentation and conforms to or builds an industry standard for your products.

# Benefits of a CL
Adopting and enforcing a CL is the solution to many technical writing issues.
* If your organization has a team of writers, the CL enforces consistency of the content among the writers. If you have one writer, the CL enforces consistency over time among the documents.
* If you translate your content, the reduced vocabulary and grammar and the re-use of matching content, makes translation significantly cheaper and often of better quality.
* If you have a global market but do not have the budget for localization, the CL makes it easier for non-native speakers to read and use your documentation correctly. If your documentation is online, built-in machine translation (such as Google Translate) will give better results.
* If the technical writers in your organization internalize your CL and re-use strategy, their productivity will increase.
* Reduce your content by at least 30% without loss of information. Concise documentation makes it easier for users to find what is relevant to them at the time, makes clear to reviewers and stake-holders what is not relevant or incorrect, and makes the documented steps easier to follow.

# Scope of Project
This is a personal project of Rochelle Fisher, July 2025. The goal is to make a sample of technical writing and a sample of a proprietary CL for cybersecurity.
If you use part, parts, or all of this project for personal use, for profit, or for an organization (non-profit or for-profit), you must include a reference to this project or its documentation.
